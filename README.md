### Background
In late 2016, I had become fed up with the labourous and repetitive tasks of writing as-built documentation for my IT infrastructure projects. I was eager to find a way to automate the process, and also had a keen desire to learn PowerShell. It was obvious that this was the perfect opportunity to increase my PowerShell knowledge whilst also working to automate my way out of this misery.

> As Built Report is a configuration document framework which utilises PowerShell to produce as-built documentation in multiple document formats for multiple vendors and technologies.

As I was most familiar with VMware and PowerCLI, my initial aim was to automate the documentation of VMware vSphere environments. However I soon realised that it would be better to expand the project to include other vendors and technologies as well. 

I slowly began to develop some code to capture the information I required, the only issue I had was with how I wanted to present it. I wanted documents to be consistent in their appearance and avaliable in HTML and Word formats. It wasn't until I discovered [PScribo](https://github.com/iainbrighton/PScribo) by [Iain Brighton](https://twitter.com/iainbrighton) that AsBuiltReport truly came to life.

Over the past few years, AsBuiltReport has been transformed from a single PowerShell script, into a fully modular architecture, with multiple report modules now published on the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=AsBuiltReport).

In 2018, myself & [Matt Allford](https://github.com/MattAllford) (a lead contributor to the project) presented the project to an audience of 500+ attendees at VMworld US in Las Vegas. Our session ["Documenting Your Virtual Infrastructure with PowerShell & PowerCLI"](https://youtu.be/aQqHSEIUHl8?t=28) went on to become the highest veiwed session for both VMworld US/EU in 2018! :tada: :muscle: :sunglasses:
